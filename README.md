## Tutorial

###### January 8th 2021 - @backstage/create-app - v0.4.5
###### Modified from documentation published in https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/quickstart-app-auth

<br />

> This document takes you through setting up a Backstage app that runs in your
> own environment. It starts with a skeleton install and verifying of the
> monorepo's functionality. Next, authentication is added and tested.
>
> This document assumes you have Node.js 12 active along with Yarn and Python.
> Please note, that at the time of this writing, the current version is v0.4.5
> This guide can still be used with future versions, just, verify as you go.

# The Skeleton Application

From the terminal:

1. Create a (monorepo) application: `npx @backstage/create-app`
1. Enter an `id` for your new app like `mybiz-backstage` I went with
   `simple-backstage-app`
1. Choose `SQLite` as your database. This is the quickest way to get started as
   PostgreSQL requires additional setup not covered here.
1. Start your backend: `yarn --cwd packages/backend start`

```zsh
# You should see positive verbiage in your terminal output
2020-09-11T22:20:26.712Z backstage info Listening on :7000
```

5. Finally, start the frontend. Open a new terminal window and from the root of
   your project, run: `yarn start`

```zsh
# You should see positive verbiage in your terminal output
ℹ ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:3000/
```

Once the app compiles, a browser window should have popped with your stand-alone
application loaded at `localhost:3000`. This could take a couple minutes.

```zsh
# You should see positive verbiage in your terminal output
ℹℹ ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.
```

Since there is no auth currently configured, you are automatically entered as a
guest. Let's fix that now and add auth.

# The Auth Configuration

Default Backstage installation includes multiple authentication providers out of
the box. The steps to enable new authentication provider in Backstage are very
similar to each other, the biggest difference is usually configuring the
external authentication provider. Please see a subset of possible providers and
instructions to integrate them below. Steps 1 & 2 are described separately for
each provider and steps beyond that are common for all.

</details>

3. Set environment variables in whatever fashion is easiest for you. I chose to
   add mine to my `.zshrc` profile.

```zsh
# For macOS Catalina & Z Shell
# ------ simple-backstage-app GitHub
#
# (Change the name of the environment variables based on your auth setup above)
export AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=xxx
export AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
# export AUTH_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_INSTANCE_URL=https://github.{MY_BIZ}.com
```

4. And of course I need to source that file.

```zsh
# Loading the new variables
% source ~/.zshrc

# Any other currently opened terminals need to be restarted to pick up the new values
# verify your setup by running env
% env
# should output something like
> ...
> AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=xxx
> AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
> ...
```

5. Open and change \_root > packages > app > src >`App.tsx` to use correct
   authentication provider reference

```tsx
import { githubAuthApiRef, SignInPage } from '@backstage/core';
```

Modify the imported reference based on authentication method selected above

| Auth Provider | Import Name         |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Github        | githubAuthApiRef    |
| Gitlab        | gitlabAuthApiRef    |
| Google        | googleAuthApiRef    |
| Microsoft     | microsoftAuthApiRef |
| Auth0         | googleAuthApiRef    |

6. In the same file, modify createApp

Remember to modify the provider information based on the table above.

```tsx
const app = createApp({
  apis,
  plugins: Object.values(plugins),
  components: {
    SignInPage: props => {
      return (
        <SignInPage
          {...props}
          providers={[
            {
              id: 'github-auth-provider',
              title: 'GitHub',
              message: 'Simple Backstage Application Login',
              apiRef: githubAuthApiRef,
            },
          ]}
          align="center"
        />
      );
    },
  },
});
```

After finishing setting up one (or multiple) authentication providers defined
above you can start the backend and frontend as before

When the browser loads, you should be presented with a login page for GitHub.
Login as usual with your GitHub account. If this is your first time, you will be
asked to authorize and then are redirected to the catalog page if all is well.

For more information you can clone the repository:
https://github.com/RoadieHQ/backstage-auth-example Each authentication setting
is set up there on a branch named after the authentication provider.
